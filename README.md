## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Working on this project helped me solidify my understanding of responsive design and CSS Flexbox. Here are a few key takeaways:

- **Semantic HTML5**: Ensuring the HTML structure is semantic for better accessibility and SEO.
- **CSS Flexbox**: Using Flexbox for aligning items in a clean and responsive manner.
- **Google Fonts**: Integrating custom fonts from Google Fonts for better typography.

Here are the code snippet demonstrating parts of the project I'm proud of:

```css
html,
body {
  margin: 0;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
}

.main {
  margin-top: 16%;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}

.card {
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  text-align: center;
  max-width: 290px;
  padding: 17px;
  border-radius: 20px;
}

.card img {
  border-radius: 10px;
  max-width: 100%;
  max-height: 100%;
}

.heading {
  font-family: "Outfit", sans-serif;
  font-size: 22px;
  font-weight: 700;
  color: #1f314f;
  padding-top: 17px;
}

.subheading {
  font-family: "Outfit", sans-serif;
  font-size: 15px;
  font-weight: 400;
  color: hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
  padding: 17px;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus on:

- Enhancing my understanding of CSS Grid for more complex layouts.
- Improving accessibility features in my projects.
- Exploring modern CSS frameworks and libraries to speed up development.

### Useful resources
